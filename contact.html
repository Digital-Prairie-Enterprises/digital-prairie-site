      <h2>Our Roots</h2>
      <p>
        Digital Prairie Enterprises was born in Eastland, Texas, where folks still believe in steady work, clear thinking, and keeping your word. We’re a small studio with a long view, building tools and an ecosystem to help people think straighter, map ideas, and build lasting habits.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe good tools should feel like good neighbors—helpful, dependable, never in the way. Technology ought to make life clearer, not louder.
